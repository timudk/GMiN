# Generative models in NumPy

This repository contains implementations of generative models using NumPy.

## Available implementations
1. Naive Bayes (classifier)

## In progress
1. Boltzmann machine

## Motivation
In my opinion, the best way to grasp a new generative model is by implementing it in NumPy. Only by doing so, one can fully understand the full picture of (probabilisitc) model assumptions, optimization and sampling.
